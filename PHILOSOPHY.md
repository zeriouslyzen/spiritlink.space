# SpiritLink OS: Philosophical Foundations

## üß† Neuro-Aesthetic Architecture

### User-Controlled Brainwave State UX
The platform's interface allows users to manually select their desired mental state/UX mode, creating a "living" user experience that adapts to their chosen consciousness state:

- **Delta Mode (<4 Hz)**: Deep reflection, unconscious processing ‚Üí Darker, slower animations, reduced interactivity
- **Theta Mode (4-8 Hz)**: Creativity, intuition, daydreaming ‚Üí Soft, undulating glows, fluid movements
- **Alpha Mode (8-12 Hz)**: Relaxed, calm, mind-body integration ‚Üí Gentle pulses, breathing movements
- **Beta Mode (13-30 Hz)**: Active, alert thinking ‚Üí Sharp micro-interactions, clear hierarchy
- **Gamma Mode (>30 Hz)**: Peak cognition, simultaneous processing ‚Üí Dynamic visualizations, vibrant accents

### User Control Interface
- **Manual State Selection**: Users choose their desired mental state from a simple interface
- **Real-time Adaptation**: UI immediately responds to user's chosen state
